# COMP-484-Projects
Projects for COMP 484 Web Engineering at CSUN. Coded in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.

Lab 1 is a simple HTML blog page in an early 2000s style. Lab 2 is an interactive form which utilizes JavaScript to handle events. Lab 3 is a Map Game which uses the Google Maps API as well and JavaScript/JQuery for event handling and animations. 

**Note: Lab 3 contains .mp3 files that I included only to enhance the user experience. These songs belong to Square Enix and I will remove them from the repo if I need to.**
