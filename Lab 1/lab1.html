<h2><span><time="2022-03-02">3/2/22:</time></span> Noodle</h2>
<p>We love Noodle. Noodle is perfect. Noodle is always trying her best. She gets scared a lot, so the term "scaredy cat" was actually named after Noodle. Funny enough, Noodle absolutely hates eating noodles. Her favorite food is cheese. Absolutely 10/10.</p>
